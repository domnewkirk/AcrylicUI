# AcrylicUI
AcrylicUI is a Free Control and Docking Framework for .NET5+ WinForms 

This framework was inspired by [DarkUI](https://github.com/RobinPerris/DarkUI) by Robbin Perris. However DarkUI does not support High Resolution Monitors, .NET 5+ and does not seem to be active. 

AcrylicUI is taking the best bits of DarkUI and Supporting the latest and greatet dotnet core/ .NET 5+,  Windows 11 Features like Snap Layout, Rounded Corners, Drop Shadows on Borderless Forms and Scaling for High Resolution High Dpi Monitors, and of course beautiful Windows 11 Acrylic UI panels.

Features of AcrylicUI over DarkUI:

    * Support for Acyrlic and Glass WindowPanels
    * Support for High Resolution Monitors
    * Support for Custom TitleBars and Borderless WindowPanels
    * Support for Borderless Windows Snapping
    * Support for Borderless Windows 11 Snap Layout Popups (Hack)
    * Support for .NET 5 and greater (No depenedency on .Net Full Framwork)
    * Is active

This is clearly a Work In Progress and should not be considered production ready.

There is a clear path of the work to be done to migrate all relevant Controls from DarkUI to AcrylicUI. 

My Focus is supporting my own projects and I migrate Control based on my personal priority.
